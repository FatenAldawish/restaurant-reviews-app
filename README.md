## Project Overview:

The **Restaurant Reviews** project is a web app that provide reviewa about some resturants including the map. The app design is responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also I've been added a service worker to  create a seamless offline experience for my users.

## Dependencies:

1- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
2- [Leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/)
3- [Service Worker](https://alligator.io/js/service-workers/)


## Instructions:

1. Clone the repository or download it.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open the **Terminal** or **Command Line**, to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer..
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` and explor the app ðŸŽ‰.
